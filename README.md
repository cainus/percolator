Percolator is a new kind of web application framework (for node.js) for fun and fast development of quality APIs.  

It's great for:
* quality, public-facing APIs
* single page apps
* mobile apps

Its goal is to help make RESTful APIs in JSON that aren't painful to write and aren't painful to use.

See [percolatorjs.com](http://percolatorjs.com) for more details.
